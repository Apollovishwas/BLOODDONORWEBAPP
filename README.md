# BLOOD DONOR WEBAPP



## Abstract

Finding blood donors through social media is an alternative
solution
There’s a high probability that we might not find the right donor
when we share our need on the social media but the community
the blood donor app gone a create is huge when we compare to
our local contacts.Help the user find donor quickly as possible
The number of smartphone users globally exceeded 3.5 billion in
2020, according to new statistics from eMarketer—after almost
getting there in 2019. Next year, there will be more than 1.91
billion smartphone users nationwide, a figure that will boost an
extra 12.6% to close to 4.16 billion in 2021. In this project we are
proposing a web application application for tracking Blood
Donors called Blood Donor Tracker.
Conventionally, when a patient needs blood, he/she has to
contact a blood bank or a compatible blood group of a donor in
their circle, family, and friends. However, it is difficult to find
suitable donor within a limited group of people in a given time.
In addition, there is no guarantee that blood banks will have
compatible blood group in stock. There is also steady increase in
blood donation requests posts in social networking sites (like
Facebook, twitter, Instagram, etc.) requesting for donation.
we can resolve these issues by connecting patients promptly with
a large pool of donors in the same region using this project.

## Introduction 

Blood is one of the most important elements of human
body. Blood can be defined as the fluid we have in our
bodies that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of
the body. It also carries waste to be eliminated from the
body. We have between 4 and 6 liters of blood in our
adult bodies depending on size. Millions of people need
blood every year. There are tens of thousands of pints of
blood that are needed every day to help people. Due to
deficiency of blood a person can suffer from serious
health issue and may even die. Medical science cannot
produce blood but with the blessing of medical science
blood can be transferred from one person to another. A
lot of people’s live can be saved if blood donors are
easily available.
The blood donation Application we are making puts the
power to save lives in the palm of your hand. Donating
blood and blood components are easier than ever. person just needs to have an account in our Blood
Donation Application, then he can both donate and
request for blood anytime. “BLOOD DONOR WEB
APP” is a free blood Donation app available for
Android and iOS Smartphones. Blood Donor searches,
notifies and connect thousands of blood donors in some
simple steps. Blood Donor donation app ensures hassle
free blood donation and privacy of a blood donor.
Connecting blood donors and needy reduces time which
increases the possibility of saving lives and also
eliminates the shortage of blood.
It is one of its first and only unique applications
available with feature of real- time chat (uses
Hangouts)and machine learning algorithm for finding
the best suitable donor. It uses the phone&#39;s internet
connection to let us search blood donors and recipient.
This mobile application finds the blood donor by the
Zip code. The Blood Donation App will make the
easiest and fastest way to get a best match blood donor.

## Reseach 

The main purpose of our project to make a Blood
Donation Application that is user friendly and has the
intelligence to find the best matches of blood donors by
analyzing the nearby donor’s profile. We believe that
our Blood Donation Application will bring the donors
and receives so close that blood donation will no longer
be a matter of risk and worries. At the beginning of the
project we have researched on some secondary
resources based on this. From these sources, we have
been able to know the existing functions and determined
our work outline.
T.Hilda Jenipha and R.Backiyalakshmi [1], made a
cloud based blood donation app and we get to know
about this from their paper “Android Blood Donor Life
Saving Application in Cloud Computing”. Where the
contact details will appear in alphabetical order on the
screen. In case of urgent blood requirement, one can
quickly check for contacts matching a particular or
related blood group and reach out to them via Phone
Call/SMS through the Blood donor App. Their Blood
Donor App provides list of donors in your city/area.
According to them, Cloud- based services can prove important in emergency blood delivery since they can
enable central and immediate access to donors&#39; data and
location from anywhere. Since almost everyone carries
a mobile phone with them, it ensures instant location
tracking. The location-based app, operational on android
platform, will help users easily find donors of matching
blood groups in their location and can be accessed via
their mobile numbers.
From Shek and Shilpa [2] – the authors of “Android
Blood Donor Life Saving Application in Cloud
Computing” we can understand, the importance of
having blood donation app. According to them, despite
numerous significant achievements, the discipline of
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is still incapable of
satisfactorily addressing many practical, real-world
challenges. The user’s location will be detected using
GPS. If there is need of blood, the donor with the
required blood group is identified and notified of the
requirement. The project includes algorithm which
detects accurate location of the donors, identifies the
donors who are available nearby to the location of
requester and notifies them. If the identified donors are
not available or not willing to donate blood at present
then the scope of detection is increased. This is done by
increasing the scope of search. Notifying the donor
about the need of the blood is the most important task of
the system.
Snigdha, Pratiksha, Siddhi, Pranita and Varsha [3]
thinks the problem is not insufficient number of donors,
but finding a willing donor at the right time. They want
to build a network of people who can help each other
during an emergency. Their application timely updates
the information regarding the donors where the
administrator accesses the whole information about
blood bank management system. Donor will be
prompted to enter an individual&#39;s details, like name,
phone number, and blood group. In the urgent time of a
blood requirement, someone can quickly check for
blood banks or hospitals matching a particular or related
blood group and reach out to them through the App.
Blood bank App provides list of blood banks in an area.
They feel that, a large number of blood donors are
attracted using an Android application. Since almost
everyone carries a mobile phone with them, it ensures
instant location tracking and communication. Only a
registered person, with willingness to donate blood, will
be able to access the service. In this application they are
using the GPS technology that was been to trace the
way to the blood bank. The user will get the route to
reach the desired location and he won&#39;t have to ask
manually, therefore time can be saved.
Again, from the source[4] a paper called” Blood
donation system for online users”, we have known that
most of people desire to know about online blood
donation to the patients at once. Patients want to get
blood to live at emergency time. At present people are
needed to know how to contact blood donors online.

This system provides how to get blood at their serious
time. Matcher system is implemented with Decision
Tree and Decision Table by rules. This matcher applies
the rules based on Blood Donation in Blood Bank in
Myanmar. Information about donors and patients has
been reserved in the system so that it is ready to donate
blood instantly.



## PROPOSED SCHEME
In our Application user Authentication has been done by
Google’s firebase. So, the database is in cloud. For this
app until now, email and password is enabled. Users
will input their details (Name, address, pin code,
gmailID, Blood Group, About them) and these values
will be stored in the database under the name of their
profile.
Users will be able to search the blood group of people
all people register in this app or they can sort users
using the Pin Code.
Our application is different than others because it uses
because we don&#39;t need to download this app on
emergency.
We just need to ask the google “Open the Blood donor”
The Google will automatically opens the app without
downloading it, within seconds.
Concerning user’s privacy, we don’t display people’s
phone number.
Instead, we display their hangouts ID(Gmail ID).Using
this, people can cha or share location.
